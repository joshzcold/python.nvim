## Adding a Python Dependency Backend

Within `detect.lua` is a table called `check_paths` and `check_paths_ordered_keys`

You can have either a file or pattern here to detect the python dependency program (i.e `pip` or `uv`)
which has a callback function to do the install.

`check_paths_ordered_keys` is the order of the table of precedence when detecting

## Snippets

`snip/init.lua` has a table of LuaSnip snippets.

You can add to this list and determine if the snippet can activate based on conditions like `is_in_test_file` which only loads snippets while in files with pattern `test_*`

## Tests

Tests are ran by [mini.nvim](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim) tests [module](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/TESTING.md).

You can run tests just by running `make test`

## Documentation

Docs are generated by [mini.nvim](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim) docs [module](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.doc).

Can be updated by running `make documentation`

## Lint

Checked by `stylua`

Run `make lint` to check status and `make lint-fix` to have stylua make changes.

## Examples

In the `examples` directory, you can find mock python projects to test dependency backends.
These can be used for local and automation testing.
